# Beaker-extensions

Extensions to Puppet Labs cloud enabled acceptance testing tool, [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/)

The idea of this repo is to allow the use of Beaker for features that are not required by Puppetlabs directly, so they don't have to maintain features outside of their personal scope.
